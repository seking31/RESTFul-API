Export the Express application from the app.js file.
Grading: You will earn 20 points for each of the following
• Correct setup of the Express application.
• Correct implementation and design of the GET route and the landing page.
• Correct implementation of error handling middleware.
This assignment is worth a total of 60 points. If two tasks are completed correctly, you will
earn 40 points.
Hints:
• For setting up the Express application, remember to require the Express module and
call it as a function.
• When creating the GET route, remember that the route handler methods (like GET)
take a path and a callback function as arguments.
• For the middleware functions, you can use app.use(). The middleware function for
handling 404 errors should be added after all other routes.
• In the 500 error middleware, you can set the status code using req.status(). To
return a JSON response, you can use res.json().
• Don’t forget to export the Express application at the end of the app.js file.
